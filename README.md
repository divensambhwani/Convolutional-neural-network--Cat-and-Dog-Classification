# Convolutional-neural-network--Cat-and-Dog-Classification

It shows how to load your own data and do basics of deep learning with Python, Tensorflow and Keras using a cat and dog classification dataset.

Dataset - Dogs vs Cats dataset from Microsoft.

In the end, I have downloaded an image of both dog and cat from google which is not in the dataset and have tested the model.
